HTML:
The HTML defines the structure of the webpage.

<h2> tag  
This displays the heading “Product List” at the top of the container.

<select> tag  
The dropdown menu has the id categoryFilter.  
It contains filter options: All, Clothing, Electronics, and Books.  
Users can select a category from this menu to filter the product list.

<div> tags  
A main container <div> with class "container" wraps everything.  
Inside it, another <div> with id "productList" holds individual product items.  
Each product is inside a <div> with class "product" and a data-category attribute.  
The data-category attribute (e.g., "clothing", "electronics", "books") helps JavaScript decide which products to show or hide.

<script> tag  
This contains the JavaScript logic that makes the filter dynamic.

CSS:
The CSS styles the page for better readability and layout.

Container styling  
The .container class has a border, padding, and a fixed width of 400px to group the product list neatly.

Heading styling  
The <h2> element has no extra margin at the top to keep it well aligned inside the container.

Dropdown styling  
The <select> element is styled with padding and spacing for a clean look.

Product styling  
Each product <div> has a border, padding, margin, and slightly rounded corners (border-radius: 5px).  
This makes each product look like a separate card.

Overall page styling  
The body uses Arial font and margin for spacing, giving the webpage a simple, clean appearance.

JavaScript:
The JavaScript implements the filtering functionality.

Access elements  
getElementById("categoryFilter") gets the dropdown element.  
querySelectorAll(".product") selects all product <div> elements.

Event Listener  
An event listener is added to the dropdown (filter.addEventListener("change", ...)).  
It runs whenever the user changes the selected option.

Filtering logic  
It gets the value of the selected category.  
For each product:  
If the selected category is "all" or matches the product’s data-category, the product is shown (display = "block").  
Otherwise, the product is hidden (display = "none").

Dynamic updates  
The product list updates instantly in real time as the dropdown selection changes.
