This project creates a basic live Character Counter using HTML and JavaScript.  

HTML (BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE WEBPAGE):  
There are three main tags in the HTML code: <h2>, <textarea>, and <script>.

1. <h2> tag  
Displays the heading "Live Character Counter" at the top of the page.

2. <textarea> tag  
The <textarea> tag has an id "textInput" and a placeholder "Start typing...".  
It allows users to type text, and the character count updates as they type.

3. <p> tag  
Displays the label "Characters:" followed by a <span> with id "charCount" that shows the live count.

4. <script> tag  
The <script> tag contains JavaScript code that enables the live counter functionality.  
It uses getElementById to access the textarea and span elements.  
An event listener is added to the textarea that listens for "input" events.  
Each time the user types, the function updates the character count using .value.length.

JavaScript FUNCTIONALITY:  
1. let textInput = document.getElementById("textInput");
2. let charCount = document.getElementById("charCount");  
3. textInput.addEventListener("input", function() { charCount.textContent = textInput.value.length; });  
This function runs every time the user types in the textarea and updates the character count in real-time.

Learning Outcomes:  
1. Learnt how to access HTML elements using JavaScript  
2. Understood how to use event listeners for real-time updates  
3. Practiced integrating JavaScript with HTML for interactive features  
4. Gained experience in basic webpage structure and DOM manipulation
